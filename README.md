### Description:
---
This repository contains the realization of the first project of the Hexlet learning portal: Brain Games! There are 5 mini-games in the project. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, the game is considered to be completed. Incorrect answers end the game and offer to pass it again.

### System Requirements:
---
* OS Windows/Linux;
* PHP version 7+.

### Installation and startup:
---
* For installation, a Makefile with the install command is used, executing the composer install command: `make install`  
* To start the game it is enough to enter the command make with the name of the game in the command line:
  * make brain-even - in the game it is necessary to answer whether the number is even or not.
  * make brain-calc - in the game it is necessary to add, subtract or multiply two numbers and give the correct answer.
  * make brain-gcd  - in the game you have to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers and give the correct answer.
  * make brain-progression - in the game you have to find the missing element of arithmetic progression.
  * make brain-prime - in the game it is necessary to answer whether the shown number is prime or not. 

For example: `make brain-even`
